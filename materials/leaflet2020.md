# New version of the European ITS Framework Architecture

The European ITS Framework Architecture (FRAME) used for development of interconnected ITS services and systems is now in version 5:

- Updated with the current developments in ITS Services.
- Centred on (ITS) Service design.
- Convergent to current systems design methodologies.
- Easy to use and customise with off-the-shelf software.

## Keeping pace with todayâ€™s world
FRAME has been evolving for over 20 years and already covers many 
ITS topics including Traffic Management, and Traveller Information. It was
updated to include the Priority Actions in the European ITS Directive, such
as eCall, National Access Points (NAP) and Truck Parking.

## A complete picture of the value chain
Your organisation is more than the systems it builds and/or operate,
which provide the means to deliver ITS Services. The scope of the FRAME
Architecture has been expanded to enable you to create a more complete
picture of how your ITS Services are delivered and the motivation for
doing so.

## Look through various lenses
There are several ways to tell a story, depending on the audience and its
content. The same applies for the architecture of an ITS Service; for which
different views can be used to enable the study of different aspects of its
delivery. We are now introducing extra views into the FRAME Architecture
so you can visualise additional aspects of your ITS Services.

## New Development Environment
The FRAME is moving to Enterprise Architect, an up to date modelling
tool, widely known and used in industry to model architecture. It enables
modelling of complex systems used to deliver ITS Services, using
predefined toolboxes and ready-made architectures viewed from different
perspectives; effective visualization and effortless reporting.
